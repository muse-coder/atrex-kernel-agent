quantization, parent MLP, and Programmatic Dependent Launch experiments. It is
written as an English knowledge report and omits project task numbering.

## Scope

- Hardware: RTX PRO 5000 / 4000 Blackwell-GeForce, `sm_120`.
- Runtime: vLLM serving with CUDA Graph replay.
- Boundary:

```text
residual add -> RMSNorm -> MLP input NVFP4 quant -> parent MLP C1 GEMM
```

The goal was to remove or hide handoff traffic before C1. Several routes were
tested: no-PDL fused boundary, whole-A PDL handoff, row-chunk dependent
pipeline, and row-ready C1 wait-cache.

## Programmatic Dependent Launch Facts

CUDA 13 headers expose the relevant device-side APIs on the local SM120 stack:

```cuda
cudaTriggerProgrammaticLaunchCompletion();
cudaGridDependencySynchronize();
```

PDL is an inter-kernel dependency/overlap mechanism. It is not TMEM, not a
single-kernel register/shared-memory pipeline, and not a substitute for a
custom C1 mainloop. If a secondary C1 kernel is launched early, it must wait
before reading `input_fp4` and `input_sf`; otherwise it can race the producer.

## Route Summary

| Route | Correctness | Performance outcome | Decision |
|---|---|---|---|
| No-PDL fused RMSNorm + input quant | Prompt and semantic gates passed | Strict served TTFT signs flipped within noise | Keep as experiment flag only |
| Whole-A PDL handoff | Correctness-safe | Tiny component win, served TTFT regression | Do not default-enable |
| Row-chunk dependent pipeline | Bit-exact | Component timing regressed for small and large M | Do not run served gate |
| C1 row-ready wait-cache | Correctness-clean | Recovered about `1.1 us/layer` but remained operator-negative | Do not run served gate |

## No-PDL Boundary Fusion

The no-PDL route fuses residual/RMSNorm and input NVFP4 quantization before the
parent MLP path. It is correctness-safe, but strict served TTFT did not prove a
stable win. Across prompt lengths, two-order averages stayed below about
`0.3 ms` absolute and changed sign.

The useful interpretation is narrow: the boundary is a safe experiment surface
and a source-map for larger fusion, not a default optimization.

## Whole-A PDL Handoff

Whole-A PDL releases the dependent C1 launch only after the full A payload and
scale have been produced. This is safe, but it does not create tile-level
producer/consumer overlap.

Representative component timing showed small wins at some M values, including
about `10-12 us` at smaller M and only about `1.5 us` at a larger M. Served
streaming TTFT regressed from roughly `260.5 ms` to `262.7 ms`. Under CUDA
Graph, ordinary host launch overhead is already reduced, so the PDL dependency,
producer-side fence/trigger, and scheduling disturbance can erase the component
gain.

## Row-Chunk PDL Pipeline

Row-chunk PDL tries to overlap quantization for one row chunk with C1/C2 work
for another chunk. It was bit-exact but slower. Representative paired medians
regressed by about `23 us`, `11 us`, and `121 us` across small, medium, and
large M cases.

The overhead sources were:

- repeated C1/C2 GEMM launches;
- repeated CUTLASS scheduler/workspace setup;
- lower tile utilization for chunked M;
- extra chunk-output copies;
- synchronization needed for safe temporary storage.

Even chunks that covered the whole M dimension stayed slower, so the issue was
not only chunk granularity.

## C1 Wait-Cache

The row-ready C1 route publishes per-row or per-chunk readiness and makes C1
wait before loading A/input scale. A cached wait avoids repeated waits for
consecutive N tiles covering the same M chunk.

The cache was real but insufficient: paired median delta improved from about
`+9.4 us` to `+8.2 us`, where positive means slower than baseline. The
remaining bottleneck is not just repeated acquire-loads. C1 CTAs can still
occupy SM resources while waiting on unready chunks, and the publication/wait
protocol itself costs time.

## Practical Boundary

Do not promote these PDL routes without a non-negative operator gate on clean
repeated runs. In particular:

- Do not run served TTFT when component timing is already negative.
- Do not rely on whole-A PDL for tile-level overlap.
- Do not launch stock C1 early unless it performs a device-side dependency
  wait before A/input-scale loads.
- Do not call a sub-millisecond served delta a stable optimization unless
  order-controlled prompt matrices keep the same sign.

## Plausible Future Directions

The remaining viable routes require a different C1 dataflow:

- a custom C1 prologue/mainloop that can launch early, do B-independent work,
  and wait immediately before A/input-scale load;
- a row-chunk-aware scheduler that avoids occupying SMs with CTAs spinning on
  unready chunks;
- a single-kernel register/shared-memory publish queue that avoids global
  handoff traffic.

These are new kernel/dataflow problems, not small PDL placement tweaks.
